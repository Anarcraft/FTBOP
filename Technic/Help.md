Game won't start: Did you allocate at least 3GB RAM in your launcher?

Game won't start, sits on "initializing minecraft engine": Remove the "liteloader-1.7.10.jar" mod.  You will need to install another map mod (JourneyMap for example).

If you have any issues please file them at the [url=github.com/Anarcraft/FTBOP]FTBOP Git Repository[/url] unless you know when it's appropriate to file directly with the mod developer.
Please file any suggestions on the [url=github.com/Anarcraft/FTBOP]FTBOP Git Repository[/url].
