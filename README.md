## Free To Be OP 1.0.6
### By Anarcraft & Team Underground Lounge

A tech, magic and over powered themed modpack inspired by the Direwolf20 pack.  It can be found on the Technic Launcher. (NOT YET!)

Mods already at a stable version won’t be updated until another stable version is available (unless we are forced into updating), beta/alpha mods will continue to receive updates of any kind until they are considered stable.  World resets will NOT be required (at least that’s the goal).

### Requirements:
Minimum of 2GB allocated RAM.  2GB minimum and 3GB maximum will be set.<br>
Java 7 minimum, works with Java 8.

I will probably do a 1.8 version of the pack when the time is right, all suggestions welcome…
