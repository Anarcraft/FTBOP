Game won't start: Did you allocate at least 3GB RAM in your launcher?

Game won't start, sits on "initializing minecraft engine": Remove the "liteloader-1.7.10.jar" mod.  You will need to install another map mod (JourneyMap for example).

If you have any issues please file them at the FTBOP repository unless you know when it's appropriate to file directly with the mod developer.  Please file any suggestion for FTBOP on the repository.
