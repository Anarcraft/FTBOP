FTBOP is a pack with many over powered, magical and technology mods with a few adventure mods.  With 184 mods there's a huge myriad of things to do.  Your biggest problem will probably be "where to begin?".
However, for every action there is a reaction, a balance.  Don't think just because you can be overpowered everything is going to be hunky dory, the mobs too are also free to be OP.

FTBOP has been in development since Fall of 2014 with stability and performance as the primary focus.

Included in the pack's server list is the official FTBOP sever over at UndergroundLounge.  The server is no whitelist so feel free to stop by and say hello.  UgL has a mature, friendly community who is very experienced with modded Minecraft.
